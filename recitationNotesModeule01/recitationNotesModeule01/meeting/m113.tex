\section{Injective, Surjective, and Bijective}
We want to be able to describe the personalities of functions.  I encourage you to think of functions as if they have qualities, attributes, even personalities.  We want to have a vocabulary that describes attributes of functions to understand how they behave.  To this end we will begin with some definitions that, on the surface, seem silly and useless.  However, it is me hope that by the time we get through Cantor's proof you will have a fully developed, real life context for how these attributes are used.  I want us to find \emph{meaning} in these attributes. To be honest, this is something that I never had as a student; I was simply told to learn these definitions and apply them to totally stupid contexts, with only the most feable attempt by the teacher to provide context.  This whole discussion meant nothing to me and it wasn't until much later in my career that I formed an appreciation for the implications and meanings of these ideas.  I hope I do not become my teachers, and you don't have to become the student I once was.

Let us begin the discussion with the ideas of \emph{injective}, \emph{surjective}, and \emph{bijective}.

\subsection*{Relations that are functions}
\begin{definition}[Function] A function is a relation between $X$ and $Y$ denoted $$f: X\mapsto Y$$ for which  $$ f(x) = y_1 \land f(x) = y_2 \Rightarrow y_1=y_2.$$
\end{definition}


\begin{example}[Function]
Create an example of a relation from set $X$ to set $Y$ that is a function.

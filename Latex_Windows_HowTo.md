# So you want to use Latex in Windows

After much downloading random Latex compilers we got one to work.
We decided on TexStudio

## Things you will need

**Space Required**

You are going to need about 1GB worth of space, I think there are a lot of packages, but we
will get into that later


**TexStudio**

Go to this link and click the download button:

https://www.texstudio.org/


**MiK-Tex**

MiK-Tex is pretty much a barebones of LaTeX and can be used but it will install LaTeX with it
so thats wy we are using it. The download can be found here:

https://miktex.org/download


## All the Packages

There are 72 packages that Dr. Heavilin uses on every doc so be prepared.

This is how you are going to download them

1) Opem up TexStudio
2) Go to the top right and Open a document
3) Click on one of Dr. Heavilin's LaTeX documents
4) Run it
5) It will prompt you if you would like to download X library
6) Click yes and then the next time it prompts you select that you don't want it to ask
   you every time
7) You are done!
8) Congratulations you did it!
